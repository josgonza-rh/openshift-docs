toc::[]

You can create a MachineSet to host only infrastructure components.
You apply specific Kubernetes labels to these Machines and then
update the infrastructure components to run on only those Machines. These
infrastructure nodes are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions
that are required to run the environment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Unlike earlier versions of {product-title}, you cannot move the infrastructure
components to the master Machines. To move the components, you must create a
new MachineSet.

== Creating infrastructure MachineSets for production environments

In a production deployment, deploy at least three MachineSets to hold
infrastructure components. Both the logging aggregation solution and
the service mesh deploy Elasticsearch, and Elasticsearch requires three
instances that are installed on different nodes. For high availability, install
deploy these nodes to different availability zones. Since you need different
MachineSets for each availability zone, create at least three MachineSets.

Use the sample MachineSet for your cloud.

MachineSets running on AWS support non-guaranteed xref:../machine_management/creating_machinesets/creating-machineset-aws.html#machineset-non-guaranteed-instance_creating-machineset-aws[Spot Instances]. You can save on costs by using Spot Instances at a lower price compared to
On-Demand Instances on AWS. xref:../machine_management/creating_machinesets/creating-machineset-aws.html#machineset-creating-non-guaranteed-instance_creating-machineset-aws[Configure Spot Instances] by adding `spotMarketOptions` to the MachineSet YAML file.

[id="assigning-machineset-resources-to-infra-nodes"]
== Assigning machine set resources to infrastructure nodes

After creating an infrastructure machine set, the `worker` and `infra` roles are applied to new infra nodes. The `worker` role is required for infra nodes during startup. Nodes with the `infra` role applied are not counted toward the total number of subscriptions that are required to run the environment, even when the `worker` role is also applied.

However, with an infra node being assigned as a worker, there is a chance user workloads could get inadvertently assigned to an infra node. To avoid this, you must apply a taint to the infra node and tolerations for the pods you want to control.

== Moving resources to infrastructure MachineSets

Some of the infrastructure resources are deployed in your cluster by default.
You can move them to the infrastructure MachineSets that you created.
