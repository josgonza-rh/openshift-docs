= Forwarding logs to third party systems
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

By default, {product-title} cluster logging sends logs to the default internal Elasticsearch log store, defined in the `ClusterLogging` custom resource (CR).

You can configure cluster logging to send logs to destinations outside of your {product-title} cluster instead of the default Elasticsearch log store using the following methods:

* *Sending logs using the Fluentd forward protocol*. You can create a config map to use the xref:#cluster-logging-collector-fluentd_cluster-logging-external[Fluentd *forward* protocol] to securely send logs to an external logging aggregator that accepts the Fluent *forward* protocol.

* *Sending logs using syslog*. You can create a config map to use the xref:#cluster-logging-collector-syslog_cluster-logging-external[syslog protocol] to send logs to an external syslog (RFC 3164) server.

Alternatively, you can use the xref:#cluster-logging-collector-log-forward_cluster-logging-external[Log Forwarding API], currently in Technology Preview. The Log Forwarding API, which is easier to configure than the Fluentd protocol and syslog, exposes configuration for sending logs to the internal Elasticsearch log store and to external Fluentd log aggregation solutions. 

You cannot use the config map methods and the Log Forwarding API in the same cluster.

:FeatureName: The Log Forwarding API

The methods for forwarding logs using a config map are deprecated and will be replaced by the Log Forwarding API in a future release.

[NOTE]
====
Because the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch log store does not provide secure storage for audit logs, audit logs are not stored in the internal Elasticsearch instance by default. If you want to send the audit logs to the internal log store, for example to view the audit logs in Kibana, you must use the Log Forwarding API as described in xref:../logging/config/cluster-logging-log-store.adoc#cluster-logging-elasticsearch-audit_cluster-logging-store[Forward audit logs to the log store].
