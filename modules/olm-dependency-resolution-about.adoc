= About dependency resolution

OLM manages the dependency resolution and upgrade lifecycle of running Operators. In many ways, the problems OLM faces are similar to other operating system package managers like `yum` and `rpm`.

However, there is one constraint that similar systems do not generally have that OLM does: because Operators are always running, OLM attempts to ensure that you are never left with a set of Operators that do not work with each other.

This means that OLM must never:

- install a set of Operators that require APIs that cannot be provided, or
- update an Operator in a way that breaks another that depends upon it.
