= Enabling Technology Preview features using FeatureGates

You can turn Technology Preview features on and off for all nodes in the cluster
by editing the FeatureGates Custom Resource, named *cluster*, in the
*openshift-config* project.

The following Technology Preview features are enabled by feature gates:

* `RotateKubeletServerCertificate`

* `SupportPodPidsLimit`

[IMPORTANT]
====
Turning on Technology Preview features using the `FeatureGate` custom resource cannot be undone and prevents upgrades.
