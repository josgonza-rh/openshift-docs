= MachineSets that deploy machines as Spot Instances

You can save on costs by creating a MachineSet running on AWS that deploys machines as non-guaranteed Spot Instances. Spot Instances use available AWS EC2 capacity and are less expensive than On-Demand Instances. You can use Spot Instances for workloads that can tolerate interruptions, such as batch or stateless, horizontally scalable workloads.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is strongly recommended that control plane machines are not created on Spot Instances due to the increased likelihood of the instance being terminated. Manual intervention is required to replace a terminated control plane node.
====

AWS EC2 can terminate a Spot Instance at any time. AWS gives a two-minute warning to the user when an interruption occurs. {product-title} begins to remove the workloads from the affected instances when AWS issues the termination warning.

Interruptions can occur when using Spot Instances for the following reasons:

* The instance price exceeds your maximum price.
* The demand for Spot Instances increases.
* The supply of Spot Instances decreases.

When AWS terminates an instance, a termination handler running on the Spot Instance node deletes the machine resource. To satisfy the MachineSet `replicas` quantity, the MachineSet creates a machine that requests a Spot Instance.
