= Defining webhooks in a CSV

The `ClusterServiceVersion` (CSV) resource includes a `webhookdefinitions` section to define validating and mutating admission webhooks that ship with an Operator. For example:

.CSV containing a validating admission webhook
[source,yaml]

apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterServiceVersion

      An example CSV that contains a webhook

    deploymentName: "example-webhook-deployment"

    failurePolicy: "Ignore"
    admissionReviewVersions:
    - "v1"

    rules:
    - operations:
      - "CREATE"
      apiGroups:
      - ""
      apiVersions:
      - "v1"
      resources:
      - "configmaps"
    objectSelector:
      foo: bar
    webhookPath: "/validate"
...

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) requires that you define the following:

* The `type` field must be set to either `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` or `MutatingAdmissionWebhook`, or the CSV will be placed in a failed phase.
* The CSV must contain a Deployment whose name is equivalent to the value supplied in the `deploymentName` field of the `webhookdefinition`.

When the webhook is created, OLM ensures that the webhook only acts upon namespaces that match the Operator group that the Operator is deployed in.
