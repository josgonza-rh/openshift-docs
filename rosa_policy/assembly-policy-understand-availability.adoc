= Understanding availability for {product-title}

[role="_abstract"]
Availability and disaster avoidance are extremely important aspects of any application platform. {product-title} provides many protections against failures at several levels, but customer-deployed applications must be appropriately configured for high availability. In addition, in order to account for cloud provider outages that may occur, other options are available, such as deploying a cluster across multiple availability zones or maintaining multiple clusters with failover mechanisms.
